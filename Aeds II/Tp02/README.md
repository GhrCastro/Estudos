  Besides i have finished TP02, some questions such as Q11,Q13,Q16,Q17,Q18, are still to be corrected, and may suffer variations due to output divergencies and incorrect ordenation Keys and bad written questions. (Questions already corrected, but both the older and the newer methods are still at the archives, the deprecated ones, commented)
